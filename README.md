# Schwab Index Fund Price Prediction

## Description

This is a simple machine learning model created to make predictions on the future price of the Schwab S&P 500 Index Fund (SWPPX). The data for this project was collected from Yahoo Finance. The technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Kera, scikit-learn, and NumPy. 

## Implementation
There were 2 models that were analyzed to predict the price of the fund. The first model that was used is Linear Regression. The results for the linear regression model against the actual results are pictured below.

The second model that was analyzed to predict the price of the fund was the LSTM neural network. This model provided more promising results. The results for this model are shown below.
